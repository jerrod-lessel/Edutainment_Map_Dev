            "hint": "Think: groundwater, floods, habitats, and where towns like to build things.",
            "answer": "Even when it looks dry, the river corridor shapes flooding, recharges groundwater, supports habitats, and influences where roads and cities can safely exist."

            "level": 2,
            "question": "Why is it dry so much of the year?",
            "hint": "Seasonal rain + sandy/gravelly channels are a big clue.",
            "answer": "In Mediterranean climates, most rain falls in winter, and the riverbed can be highly permeable—water often soaks into sediments or flows underground outside of storm periods."

            "question": "What’s the big engineering problem rivers create for cities?",
            "hint": "It starts with “F” and ends with “looding.”",
            "answer": "Flooding risk—rivers can go from calm to dangerous quickly, so bridges, levees, culverts, and setbacks are designed around rare-but-big storm events."
