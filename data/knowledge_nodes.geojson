            "choices": [
              "Trains love scenery and vibes.",
              "Flat land is easier, and stations sit where people + goods need access.",
              "Because the loudest whistle echoes best here.",
              "Because maps needed more icons."

            "correct": 1,
            "explain": "Railroads prefer gentle slopes and stable ground. Stations also go where they can serve people, farms/industry, and connections to roads or ports."

            ],
            "correct": 1,
            "explain": "Trains have low traction compared to rubber tires. Steep grades drastically reduce hauling capacity and can require special engines or operational limits."

            "correct": 0,
            "explain": "A 1% grade means 1 unit of rise per 100 units of run (like 1 ft up per 100 ft forward). Railroads generally aim for low grades when possible."

            "choices": [
              "Because California doesn’t get any rain.",
              "Because the channel sediments can soak up water, and most rainfall is seasonal.",
              "Because the river is artificially turned off each summer.",

            ],
            "correct": 1,
            "explain": "In a Mediterranean climate, rain is concentrated in winter. Much of the flow can also infiltrate into sandy/gravelly river sediments, so surface water disappears while subsurface flow and groundwater remain important."

            "correct": 0,
            "explain": "Flooding is the major risk: intense storms can rapidly increase discharge, forcing engineers to design bridges/culverts and plan development around floodplains and extreme events."
