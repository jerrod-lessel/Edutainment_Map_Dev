              "It doesn’t — dry rivers are basically decorative trenches.",
              "It shapes flooding, groundwater recharge, habitats, and where people build infrastructure.",

            "explain": "Even when it looks dry, the river corridor shapes flooding, recharges groundwater, supports habitats, and influences where roads and cities can safely exist."

            "choices": [
              "Because California doesn’t get any rain.",
              "Because the channel sediments can soak up water, and most rainfall is seasonal.",
              "Because the river is artificially turned off each summer.",

            ],
            "correct": 1,
            "explain": "In a Mediterranean climate, rain is concentrated in winter. Much of the flow can also infiltrate into sandy/gravelly river sediments, so surface water disappears while subsurface flow and groundwater remain important."

              "Spontaneous geysers appearing under the downtown streets.",
              "The river slowly turning into lava (rare, but dramatic).",

            "correct": 0,
            "explain": "Flooding is the major risk: intense storms can rapidly increase discharge, forcing engineers to design bridges/culverts and plan development around floodplains and extreme events."
